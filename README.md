# Detection-Mask
Detecting whether the person is wearing a face mask or not with Machine Learning using Python


1. INTRODUCTION
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, it has been a great challenge to identify people who are
affected by COVID-19, because so many people with COVID-19 showed no symptoms. COVID19 ICMR antibody kits produced high rate of false negatives that incorrectly show a person isn’t
infected. One notable symptom of COVID-19 is high body temperature. So, WHO has advised for
body temperature screening to identify COVID-19. It is also necessary to wear face mask in public
places, as numerous researches show the effectiveness of wearing facemask that reduces the spread.
There are many temperature guns available but they are not smart enough to check temperature and
facemask at the same time and alert the respected authorities to take necessary actions if the protocol
is not followed.
In many parts of the world many humans have been employed at public places of interest
such as shops, cinemas, shopping malls, schools, colleges, railway stations etc. to ensure people
wearing facemask and to screen body temperature. This could be one of the worst and risky jobs
that anyone can land into, asking people to wear facemask and to check their body temperature. It
could also lead to the transmission of COVID-19 from the common people to the concerned person
who is in charge of monitoring facemask and body temperature.
The solution to this problem is to deploy an automated facemask and body temperature
detection system powered by Raspberry Pi microcontroller. This setup has its own camera module
through which it monitors facemask and it has a non-contact temperature sensor to read the body
temperature and allows the person if they clear the COVID-19 protocols or it will alert the respected
authorities.
1.1 Objectives:
1. To study various processes of safety precautions against COVID-19
2. To design & manufacture prototype for various parameters for Face mask detector
3. To create awareness about face mask detector by making slogan, logo & YouTube video. 



2. CONCLUSION
In this project we have successfully implemented a working prototype of Face Mask
detection system. This project can be used in places with large gatherings such as schools,
colleges, offices, shopping malls etc. The system first detects whether the person is wearing a
facemask and sends the data to the microcontroller. And upon checking it opens the barrier arm
and allows the person inside. With the help of this project an automized solution is achieved hence
there’s no need for any human to monitor COVID-19 protocols. The accuracy of facemask
detection can be achieved by training the module with a larger image dataset. The PC has all the
necessary computational power for detecting facemask from image/video stream. In conclusion,
Face Mask detection can help us to reduce the large gathering of people in one place without
masks, reducing the risk of getting infected.
